# Usage and Download

When you run the script, the first page of `.chd` files will appear, numbered from 1 to 10. You can do the following:

- Navigate between pages by typing the letter `n` (Next page) or go back to a previous page by typing `p`.

- Download a game file by typing its corresponding number.

- Close the script by typing the letter `q` (Quit).

**Important** After downloading a file, remember to refresh the list of ROMs by going to the Games section and pressing the  `Select` button.
